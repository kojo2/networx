nworx.co.uk code

This is the code for nworx.co.uk
The website is a nodeJS (MEAN stack) microblogging site like Twitter, it allows a user to post to their timeline
and that post is automatically picked up by their followers. Private posts can also be created by using an @ sign
at the start of the message. Then only the @username will pick up the message (not the user's followers) and the targetted
user will receive the message whether they are following the poster or not.
A post with @username in the middle (not at the beginning) will be go out to all followers and also be picked 
up by the targetted user whether they are following the poster or not. 
Posts are limited to 140 characters.
